Product Structure
=================

Before filling your shop with products we need to introduce 3 product concepts - *product types*, *products*, *product variants*.

Overview
--------

Consider a book store. One of your *products* is a book titled "Introduction to Saleor".

The book is available in hard and soft cover, so there would be 2 *product variants*.

Type of cover is the only attribute which creates separate variants in our store, so we use *product type* named "Book" with variants enabled and a "Cover type" *variant attribute*.

Product Variants
----------------

Variants are the most important objects in your shop. All cart and stock operations use variants. Even if a product doesn't have multiple variants, the store will create one under the hood.

Products
--------

Describes common details of a few *product variants*. When the shop displays the category view, items on the list are distinct *products*. If the variant has no overridden property (example: price), the default value is taken from the *product*.

- ``available_on``
    Until this date the product is not listed in storefront and is unavailable for users.

- ``is_featured``
    Featured products are displayed on the front page.


Product Types
---------------

Think about types as templates for your products. Multiple *products* can use the same product type.

- ``product_attributes``
    Attributes shared among all *product variants*. Example: publisher; all book variants are published by same company.

- ``variant_attributes``
    It's what distinguishes different *variants*. Example: cover type; your book can be in hard or soft cover.

- ``is_shipping_required``
    Indicates whether purchases need to be delivered. Example: digital products; you won't use DHL to ship an MP3 file.

- ``has_variants``
    Turn this off if your *product* does not have multiple variants or if you want to create separate *products* for every one of them.

    This option mainly simplifies product management in the dashboard. There is always at least one *variant* created under the hood.


.. warning:: Changing a product type affects all products of this type.

.. warning:: You can't remove a product type if there are products of that type.


Attributes
----------

*Attributes* can help you better describe your products. Also, the can be used to filter items in category views.

The attribute values display in the storefront in the order that they are listed in the list in attribute details view. You can reorder them by handling an icon on the left to the values and dragging them to another position.

There are 2 types of *attributes* - choice type and text type. If you don't provide choice values, then attribute is text type.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

* *Choice type*: Colors of a t-shirt (for example 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue')
* *Text type*: Number of pages in a book


Example: Coffee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your shop sells Coffee from around the world. Customer can order 1kg, 500g and 250g packages. Orders are shipped by couriers.
